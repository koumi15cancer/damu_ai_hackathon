While this is a good starting point, explore different interpretations of 'Fun' to avoid repetition.  For example, instead of generic 'Fun', try themes like 'Retro Game Night', 'Culinary Challenge', or 'Murder Mystery Dinner'. This adds a layer of novelty and caters to diverse interests within the team.",
